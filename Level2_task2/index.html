          Subhas Chandra Bose shuub-HAHSS CHUN-drə BOHSS; 23 January 1897 – 18
          August 1945) was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British
          authority in India made him a hero among Indians, but his wartime
          alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by
          authoritarianism, anti-Semitism,and military failure. The honorific
          Netaji was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the
          Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian
          officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used
          throughout India. Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a
          large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj. The early
          recipient of an Anglocentric education, he was sent after college to
          England to take the Indian Civil Service examination. He succeeded
          with distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking the
          routine final exam, citing nationalism to be a higher calling.
          Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist movement led
          by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed
          Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group within the Congress which
          was less keen on constitutional reform and more open to socialism.
          Bose became Congress president in 1938. After reelection in 1939,
          differences arose between him and the Congress leaders, including
          Gandhi, over the future federation of British India and princely
          states, but also because discomfort had grown among the Congress
          leadership over Bose's negotiable attitude to non-violence, and his
          plans for greater powers for himself. After the large majority of the
          Congress Working Committee members resigned in protest, Bose resigned
          as president and was eventually ousted from the party.
